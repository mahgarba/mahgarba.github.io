            <h1>History of Jellabiya</h1>
            <p>Jellabiyas, also known as galabiyas or khamis, are traditional garments worn in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt and Sudan. They are loose-fitting tunics with long sleeves and an open collar, and are typically made of lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen.

                The exact origins of the jellabiya are unclear, but it is thought to have evolved from ancient Egyptian clothing. Jellabiyas were worn by both men and women in ancient Egypt, and were often depicted in paintings and other artwork from the period.
                
                Jellabiyas became particularly popular in the 19th and 20th centuries, as they were seen as a more modern and comfortable alternative to traditional Middle Eastern clothing. They were often worn by intellectuals and political figures as a symbol of national pride and modernity.
                
                Today, jellabiyas are still worn in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt and Sudan, and are also popular in other parts of the world as a cultural garment. They are often worn at cultural events and festivals, and are also popular as casual wear in hot weather.</p>

            <p>Jellabiyas are a versatile garment that can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion and the wearer's personal style. Here are a few ideas for incorporating jellabiyas into your fashion wardrobe:

                Casual wear: Jellabiyas are a great option for casual, everyday wear, especially in hot weather. Pair them with comfortable shoes and accessories, such as sandals or sneakers and a baseball cap or headscarf.
                
                Formal occasions: Jellabiyas can also be dressed up for formal occasions, such as weddings or religious festivals. Look for jellabiyas made of more formal fabrics like silk or satin, and accessorize with dress shoes and a belt.
                
                Layering: Jellabiyas can be worn over other garments for added warmth or to create a more layered look. For example, you could wear a jellabiya over a long-sleeved shirt or sweater, or layer it over a pair of jeans or leggings.
                
                Mix and match: Jellabiyas can be paired with a variety of different items in your wardrobe. Try pairing a jellabiya with a belt to cinch in the waist and create a more fitted silhouette, or wear it over a pair of shorts or a skirt for a more casual look.
                
                Overall, the key to incorporating jellabiyas into your fashion wardrobe is to be creative and have fun experimenting with different styles and combinations.</p>
            <h1>Jellabiya Care</h1>
            <p>Here are a few tips for caring for jellabiyas:

                Wash gently: Jellabiyas are typically made of lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton or linen, which can shrink or become damaged if washed improperly. To avoid shrinkage or damage, wash your jellabiya in cold water on a gentle cycle and avoid using harsh detergents or bleach.
                
                Dry naturally: After washing, it's best to hang your jellabiya up to dry naturally rather than using a dryer. The heat of a dryer can cause shrinkage and damage to the fabric.
                
                Avoid ironing: Jellabiyas are traditionally worn with a slightly wrinkled appearance, so there is usually no need to iron them. If you do need to iron your jellabiya, use a low heat setting and be sure to use a pressing cloth to protect the fabric.
                
                Store properly: When not in use, it's best to store your jellabiya in a cool, dry place. Avoid folding the jellabiya tightly, as this can cause permanent creases in the fabric. Instead, hang your jellabiya on a hanger or fold it loosely and store it in a drawer or closet.</p>
