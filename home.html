                A jellabiya (also spelled jellabiya, jellaba, or galabeya) is a traditional garment that is worn in many parts of the Middle East. Jellabiyas are typically made of lightweight cotton or linen and are characterized by their loose, flowing fit and long sleeves. They are often worn over a pair of pants or a long skirt and are fastened at the front with a row of buttons or a drawstring.

The design of jellabiyas can vary depending on the region in which they are worn. In some areas, jellabiyas are simple and unadorned, while in others they may be embroidered or decorated with intricate patterns. They also come in different colors and shapes, depending on the occasion and culture.

Jellabiyas are worn by both men and women and are considered to be a traditional and cultural garment. They are worn on daily basis, but also during special occasions, such as religious festivals, weddings and events that celebrate Middle Eastern culture. They have been worn for centuries and have remained popular as a traditional and cultural garment in many parts of the Middle East.
